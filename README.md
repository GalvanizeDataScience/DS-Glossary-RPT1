# Glossary of Data Science Terms

How to update:
1. Pull the latest version of the glossary on main branch. `git pull`
2. Create a branch from **main** `git checkout -b new_branch`
3. Make your changes on your new branch
4. Commit and push your changes `git commit -am 'commit_message'; git push -u origin new_branch`
5. Submit a pull request on github.
6. Get one other student to review your changes and merge them into **main**.

#### Terms

Predictor - see feature, regressor, independent variable. A column that we use for prediction in regression.

Regressor

Independent Variable - same as predictor

Feature

Target

Outcome

Response Variable

Dependant Variable

Error

Residual = true_y - predicted_y

Regression - ML technique used to predict numeric or continuous values, an example of this is the Cars dataset

Classification - ML technique used to predict categories of data, an example of this is the Iris dataset

Supervised - ML technique used when we know the values/classes we are trying to predict

Unsupervised - ML technique used when we do not know the values/classes we are trying to predict 

In-Sample Prediction

Out-of-Sample Prediction

Cross Validation

Training Set

Testing Set

Validation Set

Holdout Set

RMSE = root mean squared error (what you try to minimize) its in the same units as what you are trying to predict.

MAE - evaluation metric used for regression models, 

R-Squared - evaluation metric used for regression models, first seen in the KNN lecture, R^2 will be between 0 and 1 and the value says something about how much of the variance in the data the model can explain. Higher R^2 score is better.
